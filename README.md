# Wordle Solver README

## Introduction
This program is designed to assist you in finding all possible word solutions for your 9 by 9 grid in the `words.txt` file. You can add all the possible words for the given grid by using this tool. Please note that using a large word file like the one provided in [dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) may impact the program's speed, but this issue will be addressed in version 0.2.

## Getting Started
To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Run the `.exe` file to launch the program.

2. You will see a 9 by 9 grid displayed on the screen, along with a "Find Words" button.

3. Fill in your grid with letters from your Wordle game. You can navigate through the grid by pressing a letter and then pressing the "Tab" key to move to another column.

4. After you've filled in the entire grid, input the maximum number of letters for the longest word in your Wordle game. Be sure not to input a higher number than necessary, as it may slow down the program.

5. Click the "Find Words" button to start the word search process.

## Word Results
If the program finds any words that match the letters in your grid, they will be displayed at the bottom of the screen as clickable buttons. Clicking on a word button will highlight the locations on the grid where you can find that word, marked in red.

Feel free to use this tool to enhance your Wordle game experience and improve your word-solving skills. Stay tuned for version 0.2, where we plan to address the speed and layout issues. Happy word hunting!
